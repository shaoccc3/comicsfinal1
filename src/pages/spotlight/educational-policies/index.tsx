            Our Educational Policies section lists educational policies and regulations that shape the academic landscape for both students and institutions alike. Anyone
            questioning decisions, finding discrepancies, or has questions on decisions relating to policies should reference these policies.

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Adherence to these policies is critical for ensuring the structural integrity of the education system. Offering a mandatory and consistent pathway to imparted information allows
            for the standardization of what students retain in relation to what could be tested in national/standardized exams. While all policies should be reviewed periodically to ensure
            relevance, maintaining this framework assists schools, teachers, students, and parents in understanding a core expectation of academic topics from elementary through graduate
            level, and post-graduation in their respective careers.

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Higher education policies shape the framework for post-secondary educational institutions. These policies cover areas like accreditation, admissions standards, financial aid
            requirements, academic freedom, and research and teaching responsibilities. Higher education policies help establish benchmarks of success and standards of protocol for institutions to follow to ensure an equal and
            compelling education across all US territories. These policies govern diverse aspects of university operations, from academic program development to the allocation of resources. In
            higher education settings, policies establish standards for curricula and technology integration.

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            K-12 policies focus on the child from Pre-K through High School. These Educational Policy will help frame the public values needed to guide the mission of long-term education
            planning to produce quality education for every child through the higher education. These policies determine the implementation of early intervention, the construction of test based
            assessment measures, and the allocation of public funding to provide equitable education services. All K-12 policies are designed to support student achievement and prepare them for
            higher education or career readiness. Ensuring all students are equipped with foundational skills is a primary goal of these policies.
